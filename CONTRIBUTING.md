## Pull Requests

2. Make your changes
3. Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` to ensure everything compiles
4. Open a PR with a clear description of what you changed and why

## Guidelines

- Keep the component **zero-dependency** (React peer dep only)
- Use **inline styles** — no CSS imports required for consumers
- All new props should be **optional** with sensible defaults
- Add **ARIA labels** to interactive elements
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Test in both dark and light themes

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue at [github.com/GameOwerMedia/OverPlayer/issues](https://github.com/GameOwerMedia/OverPlayer/issues) with:

- What you expected vs what happened
- Browser and React version
- A minimal reproduction if possible
